# Contracts Docs

This is the documentation for smart contracts on AssetHub. It is built using Docusaurus.

## Local Development

Clone the repository and install `node`. Spawn a local server by running these commands
wherever you cloned the repository to:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

It will host the docs at `https://localhost:3000` and reloads automatically when you edit the files.
