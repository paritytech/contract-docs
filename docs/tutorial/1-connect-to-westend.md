# Connect to Westend

- Install an Ethereum wallet of your choice, such as [Talisman] or [MetaMask] browser extension.
- Create a new Ethereum account (if you donâ€™t already have one).

:::note

MetaMask enforces Ethereum contract size limits. If you want to deploy larger contracts, choose Talisman instead. Calling contracts is unaffected by this size limit.
