# Build Your First Dapp

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Install Node.js either via the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or by installing [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (a node version manager). You may then use nvm to install Node by running `nvm install --lts`.

## Build Your Dapp

To get started with building a Decentralized Application (Dapp), spin up a repository, using `create-polkadot-dapp`:
```
npx create-polkadot-dapp@latest
```
Use **react-solidity** template, that contains a monorepo of smart contract repository, together with React front-end application to interact with it, using `ethers` library.  
Follow README for instructions.
