# Build Your First Dapp

To get started with building a Decentralized Application (Dapp), spin up a repository, using `create-polkadot-dapp`:
```
npx create-polkadot-dapp@latest
```
Use **react-solidity** template, that contains a monorepo of smart contract repository, together with React front-end application to interact with it, using `ethers` library.  
Follow README for instructions.
