# Build Your First Dapp

To get started with building a Decentralized Application (Dapp), clone the following repository and follow the README instructions: [https://github.com/paritytech/contracts-boilerplate](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts-boilerplate).

The repository contains two boilerplates:

1. **React and Ether.js**: This boilerplate uses React and Ether.js, a well-established library for interacting with Solidity contracts.
2. **Modern TypeScript with wagmi**: This boilerplate offers a more modern approach, fully typed, and includes powerful React hooks provided by wagmi.
